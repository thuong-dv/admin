NOTIFY 7.x MODULE README
------------------------

Notify is a simple, lightweight notification module. It provides
e-mail notifications to subscribers about updates and changes to the
Drupal web site.

Submit bug reports and comments via the project's issues queue on
drupal.org: http://drupal.org/project/issues/notify.

------------------------
REQUIREMENTS
------------------------

This module requires a supported version of Drupal and cron to be
running.

------------------------
INSTALLATION
------------------------

1. Extract the notify project directory into the directory where you
   keep contributed modules (e.g. sites/all/modules/).

2. Enable the notify module on the Modules list page.  The database
   tables will be created automagically for you at this point.

3. Run the update script if you're upgrading from 7.x-1.0-alpha1.

4. Modify permissions on the People >> Permissions page.

   To adminster the notify main settings and user notfification
   settings, grant the permission "administer notify".

   To adminster the notificaton queue (flush and truncate), grant the
   permission "administer notify queue".

   To set the notification checkbox default on new user registration
   form, or let new users opt in for notifications during
   registration, you must grant the anonymous user the right to
   "access notify".  To allow users to control their own notification
   settings (recommended) you must also grant authenticated users the
   right to "access notify".

5. Configure the other general notification settings.

   See the "Usage" section below for details.

Note that after installing Notify. no users will be subscribed to
notificatons.  Before anyone is subscribed, no notifications will be
sent.

------------------------
MISCELLANEOUS	
------------------------

The administrative interface is at: Administer >> Configuration >>
People >> Notification settings.

The administrative interface consists of three tabs:

The Settings tab allow you to configure how the module shall work.

You can specify how often notifications are sent, the hour to send
them (if the frequency is one day or greater), the number of failed
sends after which notifications are disabled, and the maximum number
of notifications to send out per cron run.

When setting how often notifications are sent, note that e-mail
updates can only happen as frequently as the cron is set to run.

If you check "Include updated posts in notifications", any change to a
node or content will cause it to be included in the next notification.
Note that even minor changes, such as correcting a trivial typo or
setting or unsetting the "sticky" attribute for the node will flag it
as updated, so use this option with caution in order to avoid excess
notificatons.

If you check "Administrators shall be notified about unpublished
content", users belonging to roles with the "administer nodes" and
"administer comments" permissions granted will receive notifications
about unpublished content.  This is mainly to make the module useful
to manage moderation queues.  Note that notifications about
unpublished content are only sent once.

The checkbox under "Notification default for new users" is used as the
default value for the notification master switch on the new user
registration.  Note that this setting has no effect unless you grant
the anonymous user the right to access notify.

The final section under the Settings tab let you set up notification
by node type.  Having nothing checked defaults to sending
notifications about all node types.

The Queue tab is to process and inspect the notification queue.

The radio buttons below the heading "Process notification queue" has
the following meanings:

 - Send batch now: Force sending a notification batch without waiting
   for the next cron run.  Note that if the number of notifications
   queue exceeds the maximum number of notifications to send out per
   cron run, only the maximum number is sent.  The rest will be queued
   for the next cron run or the next manual send batch (whatever
   happens first).

 - Truncate queue: Truncate the queue of pending notifications without
   sending out any notifications.

The status panel gives the administrator a rough overview of the
current state of the notification queue.

The Users tab is to review and alter per-user settings for those users
that have the master switch for notifications set to Enabled.

------------------------
ADMINISTRATION
------------------------

If you enable node revisions (http://drupal.org/node/320614), the
notification e-mail will also mention the name of the last person to
edit the node.

To manage your own notification preferences, click on the
"Notification settings" on your "My account" page.
